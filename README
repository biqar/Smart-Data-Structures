Implementation details to consider when building on Smart Data Structures

TODO:
* improve portability to non-x86_64; it's mostly there now but needs additions to portable defs
* may also need additional memory barriers for non-x86 consistency model 
* make time-based-wait in FCBase portable across machines; is nanosleep accurate enough?
* implement data structure peek (contain) methods and more if desired
* fix bug in ComTreeQueue consistently preventing it from running. is it a simple error?
* fix bug in OyamaQueueCom that causes infrequent segfault
